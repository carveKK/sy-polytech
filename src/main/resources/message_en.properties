product.pvc.thisIsPvc=PVC is a kind of plastic that has been loved for a long time because it is the cheapest among plastics, easy to handle, easy to reprocess, and has various properties and shapes depending on the type and amount of additives. <br>\
\
Recently, it has been treated as a badass due to the problem of chlorine bound to PVC and environmental problems with lead-based heat stabilizers and phthalate-based plasticizers\
Recently, with the development and use of eco-friendly thermal stabilizers and eco-friendly plasticizers, their use is increasing. PVC Resin has a weak vulnerability to heat in its structure.\
For this reason, the resin cannot be used alone and must be used in combination with other additives. This kind of thing is called PVC compounding. <br>\
\
In particular, it can be said that the addition of a heat stabilizer is essential in order to compensate for the weak characteristics of heat. The most important technology of PVC Compounding is to mix additives in a certain ratio to satisfy the required properties.

product.xlpe.crosslinkingMethod=Crosslinking Method
product.xlpe.thisIsXlpe=XLPE is a material that gives thermosetting and viscoelasticity to polyethylene by mixing polyethylene (polyethylene:PE) with an organic vulcanizing agent and vulcanizing (crosslinking) polyethylene (PE) with a crosslinking facility to make the polyethylene structure in a bonded state (crosslinked state) It is widely used in materials. When supplying electricity, it is used as an insulation material for wires used from substation to home supply.<br><br>\
In order to avoid the use of expensive cross-linking equipment, silane compound is mixed with polyethylene (PE), and radical reaction occurs due to heat during material processing (extrusion, etc.) and moisture (hot water, etc.) The cross-linking reaction is completed by this, making the polyethylene (PE) structure into a network-bonded structure (cross-linking structure) to have viscoelasticity.\
It is mainly used for low voltage (600V) insulation materials, and is used for power supply to factory facilities and wires such as panels.

product.tpe.aboutThermoplastics=About thermoplastics
product.tpe.whatIsThermoplastic=What is thermoplastic?
product.tpe.thisIsThermoplastic=Thermoplastic resin is a generic term for plastics that soften when heated to show plasticity and solidify when cooled.\
In the heating process, a slight oxidation reaction may be accompanied by a thermal decomposition reaction, but there is no change in the essential molecular structure.<br>\
\
Therefore, the molding cycle is generally shorter than in the case of thermosetting resins.\
It can be applied to mass production of molded products of the same shape, and it is also possible to reuse scrap or defective products.\
Representative plastics belonging to thermoplastic resins include polyethylene, polypropylene, vinyl chloride resin, vinyl acetate resin, polystyrene, ABS resin, and acrylic resin.<br>\
\
Typical products are polypropylene packaging films, stretched tapes, fibers, pipes, daily necessities, toys/industrial parts, containers, etc. There are paints and acrylic boards.
